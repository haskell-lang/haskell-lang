## Ensuring site quality

One of the problems with the old web sites (wiki, haskell.org) is that
they catered just for the newbie audience, which lead to a kind of
stagnation of interest. Newbies aren't interested in contributing, and
experts don't bother going to the homepage.

So we try to solve that problem by catering to both audiences, the
experts will care that the site experience is good, and maybe
contribute to both their interest and to the newbie interest,
benefiting everybody.

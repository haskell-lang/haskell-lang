<p class="noindent"> In September of 1987 a meeting was held at the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer
Architecture (FPCA&#x00A0;&#8217;87) in Portland, Oregon, to discuss an unfortunate situation in the functional programming
community: there had come into being more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages, all
similar in expressive power and semantic underpinnings. There was a strong consensus at this meeting
that more widespread use of this class of functional languages<a 
 id="dx3-2001"></a> was being hampered by the lack of a
common language. It was decided that a committee should be formed to design such a language, providing
faster communication of new ideas, a stable foundation for real applications development, and a vehicle
through which others would be encouraged to use functional languages. This document describes the
result of that (and subsequent) committee&#8217;s efforts: a purely functional programming language called
Haskell, <a 
 id="dx3-2002"></a>named after the logician Haskell B.&#x00A0;Curry<a 
 id="dx3-2003"></a> whose work provides the logical basis for much of
ours.
<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-3000"></a>Goals</h3>
<p class="noindent"> The committee&#8217;s primary goal was to design a language that satisfied these constraints:
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3002x1">It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications, including building large systems.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3004x2">It should be completely described via the publication of a formal syntax and semantics.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3006x3">It should be freely available. Anyone should be permitted to implement the language and distribute it
     to whomever they please.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3008x4">It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3010x5">It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional programming languages.</li></ol>

<p class="noindent"> The committee intended that Haskell would serve as a basis for future research in language design, and hoped that
extensions or variants of the language would appear, incorporating experimental features.
 <p class="noindent"> Haskell has indeed evolved continuously since its original publication. By the middle of 1997, there
had been five versions of the language design (from Haskell 1.0 &#8211; 1.4). At the 1997 Haskell Workshop
in Amsterdam, it was decided that a stable variant of Haskell was needed; this became &#8220;Haskell 98&#8221;
and was published in February 1999. The fixing of minor bugs led to the <span 
class="ptmri7t-">Revised </span>Haskell 98 Report in
2002.
 <p class="noindent"> At the 2005 Haskell Workshop, the consensus was that so many extensions to the official language were widely used
(and supported by multiple implementations), that it was worthwhile to define another iteration of the language
standard, essentially to codify (and legitimise) the status quo.
 <p class="noindent"> The Haskell Prime effort was thus conceived as a relatively conservative extension of Haskell 98, taking on board
new features only where they were well understood and widely agreed upon. It too was intended to be a
&#8220;stable&#8221; language, yet reflecting the considerable progress in research on language design in recent
years.
 <p class="noindent"> After several years exploring the design space, it was decided that a single monolithic revision of the
language was too large a task, and the best way to make progress was to evolve the language in small
incremental steps, each revision integrating only a small number of well-understood extensions and changes.
Haskell 2010 is the first revision to be created in this way, and new revisions are expected once per year.

<p class="noindent"> Haskell was created, and continues to be sustained, by an active community of researchers and application
programmers. Those who served on the Language and Library committees, in particular, devoted a
huge amount of time and energy to the language. Here they are, with their affiliation(s) for the relevant

 <p class="noindent"> Finally, aside from the important foundational work laid by Church, Rosser, Curry, and others on the lambda
calculus, it is right to acknowledge the influence of many noteworthy programming languages developed over the
years. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of many ideas, the following languages were particularly
influential: Lisp (and its modern-day incarnations Common Lisp and Scheme); Landin&#8217;s ISWIM; APL; Backus&#8217;s FP
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="haskellli3.html#Xback78">1</a>]</span>; ML and Standard ML; Hope and Hope<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span></sup>; Clean; Id; Gofer; Sisal; and Turner&#8217;s series of languages culminating in

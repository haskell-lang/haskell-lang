We are happy to announce the launch of a new Haskell community nexus
site: http://haskell-lang.org/. This website is aimed at providing
modern best practices information for the Haskell programming
language, and in particular with providing the best possible new user
experience. The aim is to lower the barrier to getting started with
Haskell, and ultimately increase adoption of Haskell in the greater
programming community.

The launch of this website is paired with the launch of a number of
additional community resources, including:

* A [new Github organization](https://github.com/haskell-lang) (including [the code for the website itself](https://github.com/haskell-lang/haskell-lang))
* A [new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell_lang)
* A new `#haskell-lang` IRC channel on Freenode
* A [new Twitter account](https://twitter.com/haskell_lang)

These community resources are open to all, and in particular to those
interested in making Haskell as welcoming a language, community, and
ecosystem as can be managed. We encourage all Haskellers to join, and
to take part in lively discussions of how to improve the state of the
art within Haskell.

Some of you may be wondering why we need a new community
homepage. Many of us disagree with the direction the current
haskell.org website has taken, and in particular with giving
recommendations that harm the new user experience (in particular, by
pushing the
[Haskell Platform](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-community/2015-September/000014.html)). The
decision to push the Haskell Platform is contrary to widespread
community consensus, and has been dictated by a few individuals. We
intend here to create a website that is deeply in touch with the needs
of Haskellers today and always provides appropriate resources,
especially for new users.

As this community is just forming, now is the perfect time to get
involved. Post questions and comments on Reddit, Tweet to us, send
pull requests for the website, and open issues. This community will
become what you put into it, so help shape it from the beginning!

### Why a new site?

Since it is a common question in such statements, let us ask it
directly here: why create a new website instead of working to
collaborate with those who run haskell.org and the Haskell Platform?
In the opinion of the team behind haskell-lang.org, the ability of
outsiders to affect any meaningful change in these projects is small,
and the effort required to do so is very high. Therefore, our time is
best spent creating new community resources, in order to deliver the
most value for our time. Similar decisions have already been made in
creating the [Stack build tool](http://haskellstack.com/) and
[Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/).
